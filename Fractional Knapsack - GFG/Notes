Approach: 

The greedy method to maximize our answer will be to pick up the items with higher values.
Since it is possible to break the items as well we should focus on picking up items having higher value /weight first. To achieve this,
items should be sorted in decreasing order with respect to their value /weight. Once the items are sorted we can iterate.
Pick up items with weight lesser than or equal to the current capacity of the knapsack. In the end, if the weight of an item becomes more than what we can carry, 
break the item into smaller units. Calculate its value according to our current capacity and add this new value to our answer.
