// Intuition Behind Working :
// When the elements are the same as the candidate element, votes are incremented when some other element is found not equal to the candidate element. We decreased the count. 
// This actually means that we are decreasing the priority of winning ability of the selected candidate, 
// since we know that if the candidate is a majority it occurs more than N/2 times and the remaining elements are less than N/2.
// We keep decreasing the votes since we found some different element than the candidate element. When votes become 0, 
// this actually means that there are the same number of different elements, which should not be the case for the element to be the majority element.
// So the candidate element cannot be the majority, so we choose the present element as the candidate and continue the same till all the elements get finished.
// The final candidate would be our majority element. We check using the 2nd traversal to see whether its count is greater than N/2. If it is true, 
// we consider it as the majority element.
